ByteGuard: Cyber Sentinel

This challenge summons defenders to safeguard digital systems against relentless cyber threats. Participants are tasked with analyzing breaches, deciphering attacker tactics, and thwarting suspicious activities. As an incident response team member, utilize your threat detection and analysis skills to secure your digital systems.


Activity Summary

This CTF was focused on blue team activities and analyzing logs from a Windows system to discover indicators of compromise and identify methods used by attackers to gain persistence on the system. The CTF contained two primary logs from the system including the security log and the powershell log from the system. Analyzing the logs at first was simply looking for basic information such as IP's that were being used to brute force and discovering the compromised user. 

Once those items were discovered it became a much harder challenged that then required lots of research and learning about different methods attackers use to compromise windows systems and maintain persistence. Much of what was in the logs was heavily obsfuscated using things like base64 encoding and gzip compression of base64 strings. In the end the attacker used a methood called WMI Event Subscription through the use of encoded powershell commands. These commands were encoded multiple times, split, and concatenated. They were also split over mutliple runs and combined using environment variables to hide the activity. 

Overall this challenge touched on a lot of areas that I was not directly familiar with in practice and required lots of hands on trial and error along with research to discover the flags and submit the challenge flags.
