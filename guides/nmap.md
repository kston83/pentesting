## Basic Nmap

### Basic Scanning Techniques
- **Scan a single target:** `nmap [target]`
- **Scan multiple targets:** `nmap [target1, target2, etc]`
- **Scan a range of hosts:** `nmap [target range]`
- **Scan a list of targets from a file:** `nmap -iL [list.txt]`

### Scan Types
- **Perform a quick scan:** `nmap -T4 -F [target]`
- **Scan using TCP connect:** `nmap -sT [target]`
- **Scan using TCP SYN scan (default):** `nmap -sS [target]`
- **Scan UDP ports:** `nmap -sU [target]`
- **Combine TCP SYN and UDP scan:** `nmap -sS -sU [target]`
- **Scan all ports:** `nmap -p- [target]`

### Detection Options
- **OS detection:** `nmap -O [target]`
- **Version detection:** `nmap -sV [target]`
- **Script scanning:** `nmap -sC [target]`
- **Aggressive scan (combines OS, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute):** `nmap -A [target]`

### Output Options
- **Save output to a file in a normal format:** `nmap -oN [output.txt] [target]`
- **Save output to a file in XML format:** `nmap -oX [output.xml] [target]`
- **Save output in all formats (normal, XML, and s|<):** `nmap -oA [basename] [target]`

### Miscellaneous Options
- **Increase speed/aggressiveness:** `nmap -T4 [target]`
- **Exclude hosts from a scan:** `nmap --exclude [host1, host2, etc] [targets]`
- **Send packets from a spoofed IP:** `nmap -S [IP Address] -e [interface] [target]`
- **Perform a ping only scan (no port scan):** `nmap -sn [target]`

### Advanced Scripting
- **Execute specific NSE scripts:** `nmap --script=[script.nse] [target]`
- **Execute scripts from a specific category:** `nmap --script=[category] [target]`

## Pentesting 

### Initial Reconnaissance
- **Basic scan of a target:** `nmap [target IP]`  
  *Simple command to scan a target system to identify open ports and services.*

- **Perform a fast scan:** `nmap -T4 -F [target IP]`  
  *Executes a quicker scan by reducing the number of scanned ports and using a faster timing template.*

- **Scan multiple targets:** `nmap [IP1, IP2, etc]`  
  *Allows scanning of multiple specified targets simultaneously.*

- **Scan a list of IPs from a file:** `nmap -iL [file.txt]`  
  *Reads targets from a file and performs the scan on each IP or hostname listed.*

### Comprehensive Scans
- **Full range port scan:** `nmap -p 1-65535 [target IP]`  
  *Scans all 65535 ports of a target, useful for a thorough examination.*

- **Scan using TCP SYN scan (default and stealthy):** `nmap -sS [target IP]`  
  *Initiates a SYN scan, which is less intrusive as it doesn't complete the TCP handshake.*

- **Scan all ports using TCP connect:** `nmap -sT [target IP]`  
  *Performs a full TCP connect scan, establishing a full connection, which is more detectable.*

### Service Detection
- **Detect services and versions:** `nmap -sV [target IP]`  
  *Probes open ports to determine service/version information.*

- **Run default scripts for more information:** `nmap -sC [target IP]`  
  *Executes default scripts to gather additional information from the target.*

### OS Detection
- **Detect operating system details:** `nmap -O [target IP]`  
  *Attempts to determine the operating system of the target.*

- **Combine service and OS detection:** `nmap -A [target IP]`  
  *Aggressively scans by enabling OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.*

### Aggressive and Intrusive Scanning
- **Perform an aggressive scan:** `nmap -A [target IP]`  
  *Performs an aggressive scan to collect as much information as possible about the target.*

- **Scan vulnerabilities using NSE scripts:** `nmap --script=vuln [target IP]`  
  *Runs scripts categorized as 'vuln' to identify vulnerabilities in the target.*

### Stealth and Evasion Techniques
- **Fragment packets to evade IDS:** `nmap -f [target IP]`  
  *Splits packets into smaller fragments to make detection more difficult for intrusion detection systems.*

- **Use decoys to mask the scan source:** `nmap -D RND:10 [target IP]`  
  *Uses random decoys to obscure the source of the scan, making the traffic appear to come from multiple sources.*

- **Scan through proxies (requires ncat):** `nmap -sT -Pn --proxy http://[proxy_ip]:[proxy_port] [target IP]`  
  *Conducts the scan through a proxy server to mask the scanner's IP address.*

### Output Handling
- **Save results in a normal text file:** `nmap -oN [filename.txt] [target IP]`  
  *Outputs the scan results to a text file in a readable format.*

- **Save results in XML format:** `nmap -oX [filename.xml] [target IP]`  
  *Outputs the scan results in XML format, useful for integration with other tools.*

- **Generate a comprehensive report in all available formats:** `nmap -oA [basename] [target IP]`  
  *Saves the scan results in all major formats (normal, XML, s|<) with a common base name.*

### Timing and Performance
- **Increase speed, reduce accuracy:** `nmap -T5 [target IP]`  
  *Uses the fastest scan timing option, which speeds up the scan but may miss some information.*

- **Decrease speed, increase stealth:** `nmap -T2 [target IP]`  
  *Uses a slower scanning speed that is less likely to be detected by network defenses.*

### Script Usage
- **Run a specific script against a target:** `nmap --script=[script name] [target IP]`  
  *Executes a specific Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) script against the target for detailed analysis.*

- **Run multiple scripts against a target:** `nmap --script="[script1, script2]" [target IP]`  
  *Allows for the execution of multiple scripts simultaneously.*

- **Script scanning with categories:** `nmap --script [category] [target IP]`
