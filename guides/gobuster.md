## GoBuster
GoBuster is a highly effective tool used in the realm of web penetration testing and security auditing. It is designed as a directory and file brute-forcing tool that helps in discovering hidden paths on web servers. Utilizing wordlists, GoBuster can quickly identify obscure directories and files, as well as DNS subdomains, which might be overlooked by other scanning tools.

In penetration testing, GoBuster is particularly useful for the reconnaissance phase, where testers need to map out the web application's structure and uncover hidden resources that could potentially expose vulnerabilities. This tool can be invaluable for finding unlinked resources, such as administrative interfaces, configuration files, or backup directories that could be leveraged by an attacker.

GoBuster's efficiency in brute-forcing URLs makes it a staple in the toolkit of penetration testers, enhancing their ability to perform comprehensive security assessments of web applications. Its ability to integrate with scripts and other testing frameworks also allows for automation and customization, adapting to specific testing environments and requirements.

### Basic Directory Scanning
\- **Scan directories on a website:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist]\`  
  *Uses a wordlist to brute-force directories on the specified URL.*

\- **Specify HTTP method:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -m [method]\`  
  *Allows specifying an HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) for the requests.*

### File Extension Scanning
\- **Search for files with specific extensions:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -x [extensions]\`  
  *Appends extensions to each word from the wordlist and tests for their existence on the server.*

### DNS Subdomain Brute-forcing
\- **Scan for subdomains:** \`gobuster dns -d [domain] -w [wordlist]\`  
  *Brute-forces DNS subdomains using a given wordlist.*

\- **Use a custom DNS server:** \`gobuster dns -d [domain] -w [wordlist] -r [DNS server]\`  
  *Specifies a DNS server to resolve names when brute-forcing subdomains.*

### Handling HTTP Authentication
\- **Handle HTTP Basic Auth:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -a [username:password]\`  
  *Includes basic HTTP authentication credentials in requests.*

### Cookie and Header Handling
\- **Use cookies:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -c [cookies]\`  
  *Includes specified cookies in the HTTP headers of each request.*

\- **Set custom HTTP headers:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -H [header]\`  
  *Allows setting custom HTTP headers for the requests.*

### Timeout and Proxy Settings
\- **Set request timeout:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -t [timeout]\`  
  *Sets the HTTP timeout in seconds.*

\- **Use a proxy:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -p [proxy URL]\`  
  *Routes traffic through a specified proxy.*

### Advanced Options
\- **Follow redirects:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -r\`  
  *Follows redirects that are returned by the web server.*

\- **Ignore SSL/TLS certificate verification:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -k\`  
  *Skips SSL certificate verification useful for self-signed certificates.*

\- **Set User-Agent string:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -a [User-Agent]\`  
  *Specifies a custom User-Agent string for the HTTP requests.*

### Output Handling
\- **Save output to a file:** \`gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist] -o [output file]\`  
  *Directs the results of the scan to a specified file.*

### Help and Information
\- **Display help for the 'dir' mode:** \`gobuster help dir\`  
  *Displays help information specific to directory mode.*

\- **Display help for the 'dns' mode:** \`gobuster help dns\`  
  *Shows help information specific to DNS mode.*
