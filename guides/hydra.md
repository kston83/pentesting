### Basic Usage
 **Basic password attack on FTP:** \`hydra -l [username] -p [password] ftp://[IP]\`  
  *Attempts to log into an FTP server using a single username and password.*

 **Basic password attack on SSH:** \`hydra -l [username] -p [password] ssh://[IP]\`  
  *Attempts to authenticate to an SSH server with a specified username and password.*

### Password List Attacks
 **Use a password list:** \`hydra -l [username] -P [password list file] [service]://[IP]\`  
  *Uses a list of passwords to attempt authentication against a specified username and service.*

 **Use a username list and a password list:** \`hydra -L [username list file] -P [password list file] [service]://[IP]\`  
  *Attempts to authenticate using lists of usernames and passwords against a given service.*

### Advanced Service-Specific Options
 **HTTP POST form attack:** \`hydra -l [user] -P [passlist] [IP] http-post-form "[login page]:[request body]:[failure expression]"\`  
  *Performs brute-force login attempts against an HTTP POST form, identifying failed attempts through the specified failure expression.*

 **RDP login attempt:** \`hydra -t 1 -V -f -l [username] -P [password list] rdp://[IP]\`  
  *Attempts to log into a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server using multiple passwords, stopping on the first success.*

### Advanced Options
 **Set number of tasks/threads:** \`hydra -t [number] [options]\`  
  *Specifies the number of concurrent connections (tasks) to use during the attack, impacting speed and load.*

 **Verbose output:** \`hydra -v -V [options]\`  
  *Increases verbosity of the output to show login attempts and responses, useful for troubleshooting.*

### Miscellaneous Options
 **Specify a port:** \`hydra -s [port number] [options]\`  
  *Targets a specific port number when the service is not running on the default port.*

 **Use SSL:** \`hydra -S [options]\`  
  *Enables SSL connections, required for services that are encrypted with SSL/TLS.*

### Output Handling
 **Save output to a file:** \`hydra -o [output file] [options]\`  
  *Saves the results of the brute-force attack to a specified file.*

### Help and Information
 **Display help information:** \`hydra -h\`  
  *Shows help information, including a list of all command-line options, services supported, and usage examples.*

### Example Attack Scenarios
 **Comprehensive attack on an email server (SMTP):**  
  \`hydra -L [user list] -P [password list] -f -s 587 -S -v -V smtp://[IP] PLAIN\`  
  *Attempts to authenticate against an SMTP server using a list of usernames and passwords, using explicit SSL on port 587 and stopping after the first found credentials.*
