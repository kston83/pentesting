## AutoRecon

AutoRecon is a popular reconnaissance tool used in penetration testing and ethical hacking. It's a multi-threaded network reconnaissance tool that automates the process of enumerating services on targeted systems. AutoRecon helps penetration testers by performing scans with tools like Nmap and using the results to suggest further enumeration tactics based on the open ports and services discovered.

AutoRecon is particularly useful for initial stages of a penetration test, where it helps identify potential vulnerabilities by efficiently mapping out network exposures and service configurations. It also provides detailed reports that include recommended next steps for deeper exploration based on the scan results. This tool is often appreciated for its efficiency and effectiveness in streamlining the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test.

### Basic Usage
- **Perform a basic scan on a target:** `autorecon [target IP]`  
  *Scans the target IP with default settings and scripts. Outputs will be saved in the results directory.*

### Advanced Target Specification
- **Scan multiple targets:** `autorecon [IP1, IP2, ...]`  
  *Scans multiple specified IPs simultaneously, useful for assessing several machines in a network.*

- **Scan targets from a file:** `autorecon -tL [file containing IPs]`  
  *Reads a list of targets from a specified file and performs scanning on each.*

### Configuration and Profiles
- **Use a specific profile:** `autorecon -p [profile name] [target IP]`  
  *Executes a scan using a pre-defined profile. Profiles determine the types of scans and tools used.*

- **List all available profiles:** `autorecon --list-profiles`  
  *Displays all profiles currently available in AutoRecon.*

### Output and Directory Management
- **Specify output directory:** `autorecon -o [directory] [target IP]`  
  *Directs the output of the scan results to a specified directory.*

- **Save output with a custom naming scheme:** `autorecon --hostname [custom name] [target IP]`  
  *Saves the scan results under a custom directory name based on the specified hostname.*

### Service Scanning
- **Perform service-specific scans:** `autorecon --only-scans [service scans] [target IP]`  
  *Limits scanning to specific services identified by the initial scans, like SMB, HTTP, etc.*

### Timing and Performance
- **Set the maximum number of parallel tasks:** `autorecon --parallel [number] [target IP]`  
  *Controls the number of tasks that can be run in parallel, impacting the speed and load on the network.*

### Misc Options
- **Perform a quick scan:** `autorecon --quick [target IP]`  
  *Runs a faster, less thorough scan, useful for initial assessments.*

- **Verbose output:** `autorecon -vv [target IP]`  
  *Increases verbosity of the output, providing more details about the scanning process.*

### Help and Information
- **Display help information:** `autorecon --help`  
  *Shows help information, including a list of all command-line options and usage examples.*

### Updates and Add-ons
- **Update AutoRecon:** `autorecon --update`  
  *Checks for and installs any updates available for AutoRecon.*

### Example Workflows
- **Comprehensive network scan:**  
  `autorecon -p full [network CIDR]`  
  *Performs a comprehensive scan over an entire network, using the 'full' profile for thorough enumeration.*
