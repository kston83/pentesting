# Penetration Testing Notes

## Try Hack Me

### Walking an Application

HTML Comments 

<!-- This is an example comment-->

Look for where things are stored. Attempt to explore directories where files or images are stored.

Check page source to attempt to identify if the site is using a common framework and try to identify version and if any vulnerabilities are present. 

**Developer Tools - Inspect**

Inspect elements to be able to edit things like CSS styles. In this lab you can edit the CSS style block to none to remove the payall

**Developer Tools - Debugger**
Called Sources in Google Chrome

Clicking {} at the bottom of the debugger enable pretty print and makes the javascript more readable. 

If you click the line number you insert a break point, this tells the website to stop before this line of code. 

In this lab if you insert the breakpoint

**Developer Tools -Network**

Keeps track of every external web request. Check the requests and their responses.

### Content Discovery

Manual, Automated, and OSINT

#### Manual Discovery - Robots.txt

Viewing the robots.txt can show you which parts of the site are not indexed by search engines. 

Example: 

Disallow: /staff-portal

#### Manual Discovery - Favicon

Can be used to identify framework used if not updated by developer

OWASP has a database of favicon icons to identify - https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database

This uses md5 hashes to identify the framework used

Use curl "FAVICON ADDRESS" | md5sum to get the hash. Search on OWASP database to identify framework.

#### Manual Discovery - Sitemap.xml

Lists every file website owner wants listed in search engines.

Check sitemap for areas of the website that may not be publically available or suspicious, curious areas.

#### Manual Discovery - HTTP Headers

Headers can sometimes include useful information, webserver software/programming language used. Can be used to find vulnerable versions.

Run curl "SITE ADDRESS" -v

#### Manual Discovery - Framework Stack

Either by comments in the page source or by the favicon, once the framework is discovered that can be used to find ways to exploit. In this lab the method was to review the documentaiton for the administrator login page and test default credentials that hadn't been changed. 

#### OSINT - Google Hacking / Dorking

**Examples**

site
	site:tryhackme.com
	returns results only from the specified website address
inurl
	inurl:admin
	returns results that have the specified word in the URL
filetype
	filetype:pdf
	returns results which are a particular file extension
intitle
	intitle:admin
	returns results that contain the specified word in the title

#### OSINT - Wappalyzer

Online tool and browser extension to identify what technologies a website uses, such as frameworks CMS and more. 

#### OSINT - Wayback Machine

Utilize this to discover old pages that may still be active on the website. 

#### OSINT - Github

Search for repo's for companies you are targeting. See what information you can uncover, passwords, source code, etc. 

#### OSINT - S3 Buckets

S3 buckets can be discovered in many ways, such as finding the URLs in the website's page source, GitHub repositories, or even automating the process. One common automation method is by using the company name followed by common terms such as {name}-assets, {name}-www, {name}-public, {name}-private, etc.

#### Automated Discovery

Worlists. 

##### Tools

These tools can be used to automate discovery. You can import common wordlists and scan websites for directories or files that exist in the wordlists. See the tools below:

**ffuf**
  
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.77.145/FUZZ    

**dirb**
          
dirb http://10.10.77.145/ /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt  
      
**Gobuster**
           
gobuster dir --url http://10.10.77.145/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt


### Who broke my lock?

Goal: Bruteforce Administrators Password

1. Capture logon request via burb
2. Insert position for password
3. Load wordlist
4. Run Sniper attack to bruteforce password
   1. Wait for Sniper to finish
      1. Response code 200 (succes) received for password "admin123" with username admin@juice-sh.op

### AH! Dont' Look

Goal: Access the confidential document

FTP directory is exposed to public and is shown due to linking a file in About us page. Navigate to SITEIP/ftp and downloaded confidential file. 

Goal 2: Log into MC SafeSearch's account

Goal 3: Download the Backup file

Need to use a character bypass called Poinson Null Byte - %00 - URL encoded %2500
